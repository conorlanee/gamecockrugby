                Founded in 1967, Men's rugby at the University of South Carolina boasts a long and distinguised record of Success. Carolina Rugby was founded by Sandy Frazier. He joined Fort Jackson Rugby team as their captain prior to Vietnam. In that November he met with USC's club sports administration for the recruiting requirements while gaining signatures to establish the Men's Rugby Football Club.

                South Carolina not only teaches the love of the game, but also the many skills and techniques that are neccessary to compete. A high performance standard does not discourage against players of less ability to try something new. This philosophy enables students to join a program of great moral compass to enjoy a sport that we so enjoy.
